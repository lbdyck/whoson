WHOSON Command

WHOSON is a TSO command, written in REXX, that will generate a report
of all, or selected, TSO and SSH users on all the systems within the SYSPLEX.
Will also report on zOSMF users (which includes Zowe Explorer users).

*Notes:*
 - the system level and IPL date and time are also reported for each LPAR.
 - only zOSMF users who use files or JES servics that start a TSO addres
space can be detected (step starts with IZU or procstep has lowercase).

### Also report on any other address spaces
 - find *custom* and follow instructions
 - looks for the ICH70001I message in the JESMSGLG to report on the user

Will also work as an OMVS Shell command and has been included as
whoson.rex in the git distribution for that purpose.

Installation

Copy the exec into a library in your SYSEXEC, or SYSPROC, allocated
libraries.

For use under OMVS copy the whoson.rex exec into an OMVS
directory in your PATH and then chmod +x whoson and then tag as
IBM-1047 (chtag -tc 1047).

Dependencies:

   * SDSF REXX
   * STEMEDIT   -- Not required when running under the z/OS Unix shell
   * RACF LU command

Notes
If the user is not authorized to issue the RACF lu command for the
requested userid then the name associated with the userid will be blank.

WHOSON is a TSO command, written in REXX, that will generate a report of
all, or selected, TSO and SSH users on all the systems within the SYSPLEX.

If there are special address spaces that you want to report on do a find
for *other* and add the address space or address space prefix.

WHOSON will now work under the OMVS Shell provided it has chmod +x and
is invoked using ./whoson - at least that is what I had to do to get it
to work.

Dependencies:

   * SDSF REXX
   * STEMEDIT  -- not required when run under the shell
   * RACF LU
